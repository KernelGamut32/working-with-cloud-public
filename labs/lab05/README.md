# Lab 05

## Part 3 of borathon

Continue building out the customer, account, and transaction management service that was started in <a href="../lab03/README.md" target="_blank">Lab 03</a>.

If you weren't able to finish all of the operations in the previous lab, focus on building out a single operation end-to-end (e.g., opening a new customer account). Alternatively, you can see an implementation of the various operations (to help guide your completion) by reviewing the "CustomerManagementService" solution in the "labs" folder of the GitHub repo.

In this lab, you will deploy your API to AWS using any of the following options:
1) IaaS - VM's with runtime environment to host the microservice
2) PaaS - e.g. Elastic Beanstalk in AWS
3) Containers - Cloud-deployed runtime (e.g. ECS in AWS)
