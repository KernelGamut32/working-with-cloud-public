# Lab 02

This lab provides you with the opportunity to practice creating and testing Lambda functions in AWS.

**NOTE: When naming resources, include your initials in the names used (to ensure no name collision with other LAUNCH attendees)**

## Option 1

1. Following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started-create-function.html, create a new AWS Lambda (use one of the blueprints for hello-world - NodeJS or Python)
2. You can allow the "Create Function" action to automatically generate a role for execution
3. Using the steps outlined in that tutorial, test your new function
4. If you have time (and the inclination), try adjusting the Lambda's code and testing to see the effects of your updates
5. Or try creating a new Lambda in a different language and explore through testing
6. Make sure you delete/remove all resources as outlined in the tutorial

## Option 2 (for a little more challenge)

Execute the tutorial at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started-create-function.html to get started with creating a Lambda in AWS. If you have time (and interest), execute the tutorial at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-apigateway-tutorial.html to practice creating a new Lambda + API Gateway in AWS.
