# Lab 2

This lab provides you with the opportunity to practice creating and testing a Lambda function in AWS.

**NOTE: When naming resources, include your initials in the names used (to ensure no name collision with other LAUNCH attendees)**

1. Following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started-create-function.html, create a new AWS Lambda
2. Using the steps outlined in that tutorial, test your new function
3. If you have time (and the inclination), try adjusting the Lambda's code and testing to see the effects of your updates
4. Make sure you delete/remove all resources as outlined in the tutorial
