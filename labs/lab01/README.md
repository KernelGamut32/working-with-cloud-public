# Lab 01

This lab provides you with the opportunity to practice creating and configuring an EC2 instance in AWS.

**NOTE: When naming resources, include your initials in the names used (to ensure no name collision with other LAUNCH attendees)**

## Option 1

Execute the tutorial at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html to practice creating a new EC2 instance in AWS, confirming connectivity to that instance, and cleanup.

## Option 2 (for a little more challenge)

1. Following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html, create a new Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance
2. **Do not execute step 3 yet (the cleanup step)**
3. After confirming connectivity to your instance, follow the steps outlined at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-lamp-amazon-linux-2.html to install the LAMP stack on your new instance
4. Upon completion, follow step 3 in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html to terminate the test instance created for the lab
